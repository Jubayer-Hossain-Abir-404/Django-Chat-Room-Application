* API can be used to share data with other
applications

* Series of urls or endpoints could be called
and instructions on how to work with data

* So the package which is called Django Rest Framework (DRF)
built on top of Django
specifically for django

* data would be retrived in json format

* API will have it's own url routing system

first run this command on the terminal
* pip install djangorestframework

then this is going to be copy pasted into the main
project settings Installed_Apps

* whenever imported files is not working just check the
python interpreter
