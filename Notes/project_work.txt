installed apps

* All of our views are going to be handled
inside of the views.py file from that app we created
here known as base

* chatroom urls.py is the core url file

* chatroom urls.py
one will be root urls and other one will be for the
specific file

* request object is going to be like the http object

* from django.http import HttpResponse
This is used to return HttpResponse

* def home(request):
    return HttpResponse ('Home Page')  // This home page text will be shown in the browser

This is the function that returns HttpResponse

* path('', home), As the quote doesn't contain anything that's why the project is first
loaded home function is being called 

In urlpatterns this is written
home text is just calling out the home function

* path('room/', rooms)
This creates another path
